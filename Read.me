This file is for documentation and information about the project.

The project of this title is simple Calculator using Javascript

To make any ammendments or changes in the project or to even play around with the code and design.

With Github:

1. Open Github
2. Go to the repository you wish to clone
3. Go to the green code button and copy the Github repository link.
4. Now Open your terminal
5. Change your directory to your ideal folder or desktop.
6. Then type in git clone
7. Paste the link copied from Github
8. Press enter and it will clone the repository to your local machine.
9. Now you cna open the project into your code editor.

(If you wish to instead of letting it create a default folder you could always create your own
folder by creating a folder then changing the directory)

//This is the project portion of the Read.me  

This Calculator project is a simple calculator design and format.
this allows for basic functions such as multiplication and addition.

During this I did have difficulty with my javascript.
This was due to a missunderstanding of the code and how I should format to complete certain tasks.

To resolve this Issue I commented out my code I had difficulty with as seen in the index.js file.
I then used the start of the code as a refrrence basis.
Moving forward I did an extensive amount of research and found the parseFloat function.
This allowed me to convert my input which was being defined as strings and change the
to the number after a certain decimal point as the input value would always be a number.

So this part of the code is what I am most proud of.

Then after with some help from co-pilot I was able to write the coding for the calculate that would keep 
my current result as my currentInput value afterwards.

This was a great learning experience and I am happy with the outcome of the project.
Due to this Ihave learned how to reroute my code so it acts in a loop as well as got to learn two new functions
parseFloat and switch.
However I am particalarly 78% Confident with myself as I tend confuse myself with my own code even though I understand what it means.
So of making this project am I 100% Certain of my javascript skills? No. will that
stop me from improving and attempting? Also no.
